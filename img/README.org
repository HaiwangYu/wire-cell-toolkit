#+title: Wire-Cell Imaging

* Intro

This sub-package holds Wire-Cell Toolkit 3D imaging components.

Below are some notes on them.

* Slicing

A *frame* is partitioned into time-slices of a given *span* (typically 4
or 6 ticks).

The *time* of a *slice* of index $s_i$ has is measured relative to the *time* of its *frame* $t_f$

\[ t_{s_i} = t_f + i*span \]

Note, when comparing the time of slices (and thus blobs) to depos an
arbitrary time offset can be introduced in the simulation.


A slice has *activity* which maps a *channel* (~IChannel~) to a pair of
numbers giving a *signal value* and *signal uncertainty* .
