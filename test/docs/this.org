#+title: Wire-Cell Toolkit test subpackage

The WCT ~test/~ sub package is somewhat special among its siblings as
its primary content, as the name suggests, consists of tests and not
shared library plugins or executable programs for the end user.

Each WCT sub package holds tests which are focused on that sub package
in ~<pkg>/test/~.  On the other hand, the ~test/~ sub package is intended
to hold "higher level" tests that may span multiple packages.  Some
describe this dichotomy as "unit" vs "integration" tests but that
delineation is not recognized in WCT testing.

See [[file:framework.org]] for a overview description of WCT testing and
the top level [[file:../README.org][README]] file for a listing of various "howto" documents
that will help you provide yet more tests.
