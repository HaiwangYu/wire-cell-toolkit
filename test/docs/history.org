* Historical tests

The WCT testing framework supports "historical tests" and "historical
files".  A "historical file" is simply one produced by a test and
saved to the "history" category of the test data repostiroy (see section [[Data repository]]).
A "historical test" is then a test that consumes
these files.

** Versions

A historical test may itself only run software from the current software version under test.  A historical test can not execute any code from other versions, though it may access historical files produced by other code versions.

The versions that are available for a historical file is given at build time by:

#+begin_example
wcb configure [--test-data-versions=<versions>] [--tests] [...]
#+end_example

This is an optional argument.  The WCT developers have hard-coded a list of suitable versions in the built.  However, the user is free to to override that list.  As always, tests are not on by default and the ~--tests~ option may be given at configure time so the build "remembers" tests.

During the build phase:

#+begin_example
wcb [--tests]
#+end_example

The data repository will be populated with files for the configured tests data versions.

Historical tests should only assume versions in this list but may also include the current version.

** Support

See section [[BATS]]]] for description of support for historical tests written as BATS files.
