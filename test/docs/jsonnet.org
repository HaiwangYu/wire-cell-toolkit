Jsonnet is the primary means to construct configuration files for WCT.
It's job is to build a data structure which can necessarily be very
complex.  WCT provides various low level Jsonnet functions as well as
higher level structure builders.  It can be useful to "lock" in
expectation to guard against regression in those layers.

* Running Jsonnet tests

A Jsonnet test may be compiled with the plain ~jsonnet~ command or with
the WCT version ~wcsonnet~.  By default ~jsonnet~ is used.  The two differ
mostly in their defaults.  The ~jsonnet~ command does not have the
~wire-cell-toolkit/cfg/~ directory added to its search path - though it
does when run as part of the WCT test framework.  The ~wcsonnet~ will
include any paths given in ~WIRECELL_PATH~.

* Basic Jsonnet tests

The most simple test is one that tests basic expected compilation
without a need to locate additional files.  For example:

#+begin_example
jsonnet cfg/test/test_wirecell.jsonnet
#+end_example

others require resolving files that are ~import~:

#+begin_example
jsonnet -J cfg cfg/test/test_pgraph.jsonnet
wcsonnet cfg/test/test_pgraph.jsonnet
#+end_example

* Assertions

Jsonnet provides an ~assert~ function.  These should be sprinkled liberally throughout Jsonnet test code whenever it is possible to know what some intermediate data structure should be.  See ~test_graph.jsonnet~ for an example.

* Variant tests

Some Jsonnet files result in a top level function that accepts or requires "top-level arguments" (TLAs).  These arguments may be supplied in the registration of variant tests.  For example, ~cfg/wscript_build~:

#+begin_example
with bld.smplpkg('WireCellCfg', test_use='WireCellAppps') as p:

    tuthigh = bld.path.find_resource("layers/tut-high.jsonnet")
    for det in ["pdsp", "uboone"]:
        p.rule('${WCSONNET} -A detector="+det+" ${SRC} > ${TGT}',
               source=[tuthigh], target=[det + "-tut-hight.json"])
#+end_example
